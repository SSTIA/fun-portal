# GOMOKU BRAIN COMPETITION

## Introduction

> Gomoku is an abstract strategy board game. Also called Gobang or Five in a Row, it is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a go board with 19x19 (15x15) intersections; however, because pieces are not moved or removed from the board, gomoku may also be played as a paper and pencil game. This game is known in several countries under different names.

More information about Gomoku, see [Gomoku - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku)

In our game, two players take turns as black to move first. There are six rounds in total and each player moves first for three times.

## Online Judge System

Visit [GomokuJudge](http://202.121.178.229/) to take part in our competition!

Login in via your JAccount and submit your code altered from the file **main.c** we provided.

The max size of Source code and Compiled exe are both 1MB.

There are some warnings:
1. Do not copy others' source code. All the code you submitted will be checked for plagiarism. Copycats will fail this project!
2. Do not share your source code with others. Similar submissions will be treated as plagiarism.
3. Do not use alternative account to submit your code, otherwise you will be recognized as a copycat.
4. Do not submit C++ source code. Only C language is supported.
5. Do not abuse our cloud execution service, such as intentionally trying to shutdown our judge machine.

## Compilation

The compile command is shown below (Under Windows Platform):

`gcc -O2 -s -Wall -std=c11 -o foo.exe foo.c -lm -Wl,--stack=134217728`

## Matching

Once you submit a brain, it will make a competition of 6 rounds with all others' on the judge system, and you will get 3 points if you win or 1 point if you draw (3:3).

The total points will decide your position on the scoreboard.

Position.x represents column and Position.y represents row on the Judge System.

## Opening

**Important: This part is only for reference, you may not consider it anymore in your brain.**

Black (the player who makes the first move) was long known to have a big advantage, so we will specify the beginning of the game so that both players will get the same advantage to make the game fair. 

We assume the openings are exactly the displayed 5x5 square in the center, x represents black and o represents white

The followings are all of the opening situations (on the Judge System):
