## Introduction

> Gomoku/Renju is an abstract strategy board game played in a 15 by 15 board. To avoid ambiguity, Gomoku/Renju here applies Renju rule, which means continuous line of five wins with fouls for black stone. 

More information about Renju, see [Study Renju](http://www.renju.net/study/rules.php)

In our game, two players take turns as black to move first. There are six rounds in total and each player moves first (as black) for three times.

The openings are selected from Soosorv rule openings, which are balanced for both sides.

## Online Judge System

Visit [GomokuJudge](http://focs.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/gomoku) to take part in our competition!

Login in via your JAccount and submit your code altered from the file **main.c** we provided.

For one side, time limit for initialization is 5s, time limit per move is 5s, and time limit per match is 180s. Memory limit is 350MB. The max size of Source code and Compiled exe are both 1MB.

There are some warnings:
1. Do not copy others' source code. All the code you submitted will be checked for plagiarism. Copycats will fail this project!
2. Do not share your source code with others. Similar submissions will be treated as plagiarism.
3. Do not use alternative account to submit your code, otherwise you will be recognized as a copycat.
4. Do not abuse our cloud execution service, such as intentionally trying to shutdown our judge machine.

## Deployment

(WIP)

Dependencies:

* Node.js
* MongoDB
* Redis
* rabbitMQ

Install dependencies on Debien/Ubuntu
```
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.8/install.sh | bash
$ nvm install 9 && nvm use 9
$ sudo apt-get install mongodb redis-server rabbitmq-server
```

If you are in Mainland China, it's recommended to use registry by `taobao` (or use `cnpm`)

```
$ npm config set registry https://registry.npm.taobao.org
```

Run the following command to create configuration scripts for both debug and in-production deployments.
In DEBUG mode, `config.debug.yaml` overrides default settings;
In PRODUCTION mode, `config.debug.yaml` and then `config.production.yaml` override default settings.

```
$ touch config.debug.yaml
$ touch config.production.yaml
```

Edit the configuration according to the comments given. Then, excecute the following command to build the package:

```
$ npm install -g npminstall
$ npminstall
$ npm run build:server
$ npm run build:ui
```


Finally, run

```
$ npm run start
```

to start the server.

## Openings

Black, the player who makes the first move, was long known to have a big advantage (win surely under the original rule), so some balanced openings from Soosorv rule are selected to fully this issue.

The followings are all the openings used in this competition. We assume X represents black and O represents white.
